# Somil-Portfolio
Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio — a clean, modern, and performance-focused website built to showcase who I am and what I do. This portfolio highlights my journey as a Software Engineer, my passion for AI and Space, and my drive as a state-level footballer, internationally-rated Chess player (1340) and guitarist.
